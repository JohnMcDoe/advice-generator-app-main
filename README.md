## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use the fetch API to retrieve data from a server
- How to work with JSON formatted data

### Continued development

I'm going to work on more projects which require the use of an API to get better at working with data.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - IMO, the best general reference for anything related to HTML, CSS and Javascript.
